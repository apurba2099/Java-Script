      <h1>Code Your Way to Inspiration: 7 Lines at a Time ðŸš€</h1>
      <p>
        Feeling stuck? Overwhelmed? Don't let coding become a chore. Even the
        smallest progress can spark motivation. Commit to writing just 7 lines
        of code today. It might be a bug fix, a new feature, or the start of
        something amazing. Those 7 lines can rewrite your perspective, get you
        back on track, and remind you why you love coding. Every line is a
        stepping stone on your coding journey, so celebrate each victory, no
        matter how small. Remember, even the masters began with 7 lines. So take
        a deep breath, open your coding editor, and write your way to
        inspiration!
